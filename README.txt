Deployment (Cloudflare Pages / static hosting)

1) Upload the entire folder contents (index.html + /assets) to your hosting root.
   - If using Cloudflare Pages: set the build output directory to this folder (or upload via Git).

2) IMPORTANT: Update the CTA links.
   - In index.html, search for: href="#"
   - Replace with your real application/payment links and your preferred contact link for private booking.

3) Keep the /assets file names exactly as-is.

Files
- index.html
- assets/*.webp (optimized images)
